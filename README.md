# Adventures-in-Middle-Earth --- OGL

This module should only be used by owners of the Adventure In Middle-Earth Player's Guild available from Cubicle 7 - https://www.cubicle7games.com/product/players-guide/

This is a fork of [@NotRussellCrowe](https://svn.fantasygrounds.com/forums/showthread.php?37167-Adventures-in-Middle-Earth&highlight=Adventures+in+Middle-Earth)'s version 0.4. This extension modifies the player character sheet. It adds boxes for Corruption and Shadow and the Madness and Miserable conditions. It also adds the new skills of Lore, Riddles, Traditions, and Shadow Lore.

- The packaged files are in the `compressedFiles` folder.
